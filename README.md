# README.md file Generator using Node.js

## Description

Using node.js, write an application that takes user input via inquirer prompts and populates a README.md file for use in their repository. This file will be generated in the /dist folder.

## User Story

```  
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT can quickly create a professional README for a new project 
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- A command-line application that prompts a user to provide information about their application and then generates a high-quality, professional README.md file that contains the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contribution, Tests, and Questions.

- When the user selects a license(es) for the project, then badges are added near the top of the README.md file and a notice is added to the License section that explains which license the application is covered under.

- The GitHub username and email address that are entered is added to the Questions section with a link to the GitHub profile and instructions on how to reach out with additional questions.

- If a link is clicked on in the Table of Contents, then the user is taken to the corresponding section of the README.md file.
